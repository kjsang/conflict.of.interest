A Study of the policy-making process of the Public Servant Conflict-of-Interest Prevention Act: The Application of the Multiple Streams Framework Using Text Mining  
  
## Abstract
This study analyzes the policy-making process of the Public Servant Conflict-of-Interest Prevention Act. This study combines the Multiple Stream Framework that has strong explanatory power with text mining for validation. This combination allows the enhancement of the validity of the qualitative analysis and analyzes the dynamics between actors that appear in the policy-making process using the network analysis method. Newspaper articles for this study were collected by web crawling. Then, word frequency analysis, weighted log odds ratio analysis, actor network analysis, and topic modeling analysis based on the latent Dirichlet allocation were performed with the statistical language R. The results identify the streams that appeared by each period, the major actors, events and issues that influence the policy-making process. The analysis is as follows. First, considering the national mood created by series of focusing events, the indicator as a sub-factor of the problem stream shows a significant gap with public perception. Second, the role of policy entrepreneurs in the process of establishing the government agendas is clear. However, the impact on the process of adopting agendas for the legislature turns out to be insignificant. Third, although certain actors are identified in the policy stream, they barely exert any influence in the problem stream or the political stream. Since there are only a few cases that utilize the quantitative data in the Multiple Stream Framework, this study contributes to the reproducibility of research and validity of analysis by applying text mining analysis to the Multiple Stream Framework with the statistical language R.
